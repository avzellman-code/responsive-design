						<h3>One dead, another missing after annual festival</h3>

						<p>Despite the cute dogs in the article, this curse has been haunting this village's residents ever since the construction on the nearby dam was halted due to the murder of the project's overseer. This murder sparked the beginning of what is known throughout the village as "Oyashiro's Curse", which sees the death of one person and the disappearance of another after the village's annual summer festival every year, mirroring the real events of the dam construction project murder, as the main perpetrator has disappeared and is still at large. According to the villagers, Oyashiro is the name of the guardian deity that watches over the village. In other news, everything feels weirdly familiar. Like I swear I feel like I've lived this summer hundreds of times already.</p>
