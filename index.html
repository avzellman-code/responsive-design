						<h1>WATANAGASHI FESTIVAL CONCLUDES; TWO INCIDENTS REPORTED AFTER NIGHT CEREMONY</h1>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/hinamizawa.png">
						<p>The annual Watanagashi Festival concluded last evening at the Hinamizawa Furude Shrine, drawing villagers and visiting spectators for the customary rites honoring the local deity, Oyashiro-sama. The highlight of the evening was the traditional kagura performance by shrine maiden Rika Furude, who performed the sacred dance before a hushed crowd beneath lantern light. Clad in ceremonial robes and bearing the ritual hoe, Miss Furude enacted the ancient rite symbolizing purification and the warding off of calamity. The performance concluded to sustained applause. However, in the early hours following the festival, authorities confirmed two serious incidents.</p>
						<h3>Visiting Photographer Found Dead; Clinic Worker Missing</h3>
						<p>Mr. Jiro Tomitake, a freelance photographer known for documenting the festival each year, was discovered deceased late last night. Officials have not released full details regarding the cause of death, stating only that an investigation is ongoing.</p>
						<p>In addition, Ms. Miyo Takano, affiliated with the Irie Clinic and a frequent attendee of the festival, has been reported missing. She was last seen near the shrine grounds following the ceremony. Search efforts are currently underway.</p>
						<p>The pairing of one confirmed death and one disappearance on the night of Watanagashi has renewed quiet speculation among villagers. For several consecutive years, similar incidents have occurred in close proximity to the festival. Many residents refer to this recurring pattern as “Oyashiro-sama’s Curse."</p>
