						<h1>WATANAGASHI FESTIVAL CONCLUDES; TWO INCIDENTS REPORTED AFTER NIGHT CEREMONY</h1>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/hinamizawa.png">
						<p>The annual Watanagashi Festival concluded last evening at the Hinamizawa Furude Shrine, drawing villagers and visiting spectators for the customary rites honoring the local deity, Oyashiro-sama. The highlight of the evening was the traditional kagura performance by shrine maiden Rika Furude, who performed the sacred dance before a hushed crowd beneath lantern light. Clad in ceremonial robes and bearing the ritual hoe, Miss Furude enacted the ancient rite symbolizing purification and the warding off of calamity. The performance concluded to sustained applause. However, in the early hours following the festival, authorities confirmed two serious incidents.</p>
						<h3>Visiting Photographer Found Dead; Clinic Worker Missing</h3>
						<p>Mr. Jiro Tomitake, a freelance photographer known for documenting the festival each year, was discovered deceased late last night. Officials have not released full details regarding the cause of death, stating only that an investigation is ongoing. </p>
						<p>In addition, Ms. Miyo Takano, affiliated with the Irie Clinic and a frequent attendee of the festival, has been reported missing. She was last seen near the shrine grounds following the ceremony. Search efforts are currently underway.</p>
						<p>The pairing of one confirmed death and one disappearance on the night of Watanagashi has renewed quiet speculation among villagers. For several consecutive years, similar incidents have occurred in close proximity to the festival. Many residents refer to this recurring pattern as “Oyashiro-sama’s Curse."</p>
						<h3>The Beginning of the “Curse”</h3>
						<p>Local memory dates the origin of this so-called curse to Shōwa 54 (1979), during unrest surrounding the now-canceled Hinamizawa Dam Project. That year, on the night of the Watanagashi Festival, a violent altercation broke out at the dam construction site. According to contemporary reports, a confrontation escalated between the construction manager and several workers. What began as a fight reportedly spiraled out of control, and the manager was beaten to death with tools found on site.</p>
						<p>Fearing prosecution, the group allegedly conspired to conceal the crime by dismembering the body into six parts, with each participant tasked with hiding a portion. Despite this effort, one of the men later sought medical treatment for injuries sustained in the struggle and confessed to authorities. The remaining assailants turned themselves in. However, the presumed leader of the group disappeared before he could be apprehended, and one portion of the remains was never recovered.</p>
						<p>To the people of Hinamizawa, the events of that night marked the first instance of a death and a disappearance tied to Watanagashi. In the years that followed, each festival was accompanied by another pair of tragedies. Whether coincidence or something more, the pattern became inseparable from the village’s folklore. And so, what began as a criminal case during a period of political tension gradually transformed into legend — the perceived judgment of Oyashiro-sama himself.</p>
						<h3>Origins of a Troubled Tradition</h3>
						<p>The Watanagashi Festival, whose name translates roughly to “cotton drifting,” traditionally centers on purification. Cotton offerings are symbolically cast into the river, representing the casting away of sin and misfortune.</p>
						<p>Historical accounts, however, suggest that the festival’s distant past was more severe. During periods of famine or unrest, public punishments were reportedly carried out in the deity’s name. Oral histories describe ritualized torture and harsh communal justice intended to expel corruption from the village. These practices were abolished generations ago, but echoes remain in ceremonial symbolism.</p>
						<p>Furude's shrine dance preserves these motifs in gentler form. The downward arc of the ritual hoe, once associated with tangible punishment, now signifies spiritual cleansing. The measured circling steps evoke confinement not as retribution, but as containment of misfortune. What was once literal has become allegorical — a transformation from judgment to prayer.</p>
						<p>Yet with each passing year that ends in tragedy, the old imagery regains potency in the minds of residents. As lanterns are dismantled and the cotton offerings drift downriver, Hinamizawa awakens to another uneasy morning. Whether the recent incidents prove to be tragic coincidence or something darker, the shadow of history continues to fall across the village’s most sacred night.</p>

				<h1>Village Newcomer Begins to Distrust Friends</h1>
				<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/stalking.png">
				<p>In the days following this year’s Watanagashi Festival, concern has quietly grown around the behavior of recent transfer student Keiichi Maebara, who appears to have become increasingly withdrawn and suspicious of those closest to him. Maebara, who moved to Hinamizawa earlier this month, had quickly integrated into a close-knit circle of classmates, including Rena Ryugu and Mion Sonozaki. The group was frequently seen together after school and was widely regarded as inseparable. However, following the reported death of Jirō Tomitake and the disappearance of Miyo Takano on the night of the festival, Maebara’s demeanor appears to have shifted markedly.</p>
				<p>According to individuals familiar with the situation, Maebara had asked his friends about past incidents in the village — particularly those associated with the annual pattern of one death and one disappearance. When pressed, Ryugu and Sonozaki reportedly deflected or minimized discussion of prior years’ events. While such reluctance may reflect a desire to avoid painful subjects, acquaintances say Maebara interpreted the evasiveness differently.</p>
				<p>“He started acting like they were hiding something from him,” one classmate commented. “Like he thought everyone else knew something he didn’t.” Observers report that Maebara has since become hyperaware of casual remarks, glances, and even moments of silence. Ordinary interactions — a pause before answering a question, a shared look between friends — appear to have taken on heightened significance for him.</p>
				<p>Neighbors note that Maebara has declined invitations to group activities in recent days. Instead, he has been seen walking alone, often appearing tense or deep in thought. Those close to the situation describe a growing belief on Maebara’s part that the village’s long-standing “curse” is not merely superstition, but a reality enforced by unseen hands — possibly even by people within his own circle.</p>
				<p>Ryugu, known for her upbeat personality and fondness for scavenging “treasures” from local refuse sites, reportedly attempted to visit Maebara’s home to check on him. Sonozaki, whose family holds longstanding influence in the community, has likewise been described as concerned. Both efforts, however, were allegedly met with suspicion rather than reassurance. Some residents suggest that Maebara, as an outsider, may be struggling to adjust to the insular nature of village life. Others worry that fear surrounding the recent festival incidents has amplified tensions.</p>
				<p>In a town where history and rumor intertwine, even small misunderstandings can deepen quickly. The legacy of the 1979 construction-site killing — widely regarded by villagers as the first instance of “Oyashiro-sama’s Curse” — continues to color perceptions of present events. Against this backdrop, silence can be mistaken for conspiracy, and concern for coercion.</p>
				<p>As Hinamizawa attempts to return to routine, Maebara’s apparent distrust underscores how fragile trust can become when fear takes root. Whether this strain between friends proves temporary or signals something more serious remains to be seen. For now, residents can only hope that communication, rather than suspicion, will prevail in the days ahead. (Yeah right.)</p>
